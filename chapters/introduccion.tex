\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:introduccion}

The Cosmos SDK represents a paradigm shift in the world of blockchain technology. As an open-source framework for blockchain development, it emphasizes customization and efficiency, making the creation of tailored blockchain applications more accessible. Central to this framework is the Tendermint consensus mechanism, a rapid and secure proof-of-stake methodology, which serves as the backbone of the Cosmos SDK. This technology allows developers to focus more on developing the application layer, a topic we will delve into in Chapter \ref{OCS:overview}.

The adoption of private blockchains has seen a significant rise recently, especially among businesses and organizations. These entities are increasingly recognizing the benefits of blockchain technology, such as enhanced efficiency, privacy, and control, which are not always feasible with public blockchains. The Cosmos SDK, with its modular and adaptable design, emerges as an ideal solution for crafting private blockchain applications, addressing specific needs and challenges unique to these entities.

In this thesis, we will explore the technical intricacies of the Cosmos SDK and the Tendermint consensus mechanism. We will evaluate their strengths and limitations, and discuss their practical applications, particularly in the context of private blockchains. To illustrate the practicality and real-world application of this framework, a case study of a private blockchain developed using the Cosmos SDK will be presented.

\section{Background and Motivation}

Blockchain technology, with its potential to disrupt and transform various industries, has garnered considerable attention in recent years. My engagement in this field, through projects involving \gls{nft}, smart contracts, and \gls{defi} protocols, has led me to appreciate the broader scope and potential of blockchain technology beyond these initial applications.

This technology's ability to empower individuals, streamline transactions, and promote financial inclusion, especially in underbanked regions, drives its transformative potential. This thesis is motivated by a desire to explore and elucidate the capabilities of the Cosmos SDK and Tendermint in fostering private blockchains. It aims to contribute to the expanding research landscape on blockchain technology, particularly in its application beyond public blockchain frameworks.
